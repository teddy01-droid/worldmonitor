Commit: `09174fd` on `main`

## Issues Triaged (5)

### ACTIONABLE — Fixed in Code

| ID | Title | Events | Users | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WORLDMONITOR-1G | `Error: ML request unload-model timed out after 120000ms` | 30 | 27 | Wrapped `unloadModel()` in try/catch; timeout no longer leaks as unhandled rejection. Cleans up `loadedModels` set on failure. |
| WORLDMONITOR-1F | `Error: ML request unload-model timed out after 120000ms` | 9 | 9 | Same root cause as 1G (different release build hash). |
| WORLDMONITOR-1K | `TypeError: this.player.playVideo is not a function` | 1 | 1 | Added optional chaining (`playVideo?.()`, `pauseVideo?.()`) in `LiveNewsPanel.ts`. YT IFrame API player object may not have methods ready during initialization race. |

### NOISE — Filtered

| ID | Title | Events | Users | Filter |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WORLDMONITOR-1J | `InternalError: too much recursion` | 1 | 1 | i18next internal `translate -> extractFromKey` cycle on Firefox 147. Added `/too much recursion/` to `ignoreErrors`. |
| WORLDMONITOR-1H | `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')` | 1 | 1 | maplibre-gl internal render crash (`_drawLayers -> renderLayers`). Extended `beforeSend` regex to suppress null `id`/`type` when stack is in map chunk. |

## Files Modified

|---|---|
| `src/services/ml-worker.ts` | `unloadModel()`: try/catch around `this.request()`, clean `loadedModels` on failure |
| `src/components/LiveNewsPanel.ts` | Optional chaining on `playVideo?.()` and `pauseVideo?.()` |
| `src/main.ts` | Added `/too much recursion/` to `ignoreErrors`; extended maplibre `beforeSend` filter for null `id`/`type` |
