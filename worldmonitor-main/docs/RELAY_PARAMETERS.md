# Relay Parameters (Railway + Vercel)

This document covers all environment variables used by the AIS/OpenSky relay path:

- Railway relay process: `scripts/ais-relay.cjs`
- Vercel relay proxy endpoints: `api/opensky.js`, `api/ais-snapshot.js`, `api/polymarket.js`, `api/rss-proxy.js`
- Server relay callers: `server/worldmonitor/*` handlers
- Optional browser local fallback callers in `src/services/*`

## 1) Minimum Production Setup

Set these before enabling strict relay auth.

## 2) Full Parameter Reference

## Core Relay/Auth

| Variable | Set On | Default | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AISSTREAM_API_KEY` | Railway | none | Yes | Auth for AIS upstream stream source. |
| `VITE_AISSTREAM_API_KEY` | Local dev only | none | No | Local fallback if `AISSTREAM_API_KEY` is missing. Not recommended for production. |
| `PORT` | Railway/local | `3004` | No | HTTP server listen port for relay process. |
| `WS_RELAY_URL` | Vercel + server handlers | none | Yes (for relay-backed features) | Base URL used by Vercel/server to reach Railway relay. |
| `VITE_WS_RELAY_URL` | Browser (local dev) | none | No | Localhost fallback path for direct browser calls in development only. |
| `RELAY_SHARED_SECRET` | Railway + Vercel | empty | Yes in production | Shared secret for non-public relay routes. |
| `RELAY_AUTH_HEADER` | Railway + Vercel | `x-relay-key` | No (but recommended explicit) | Header name carrying relay secret. |
| `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_RELAY` | Railway | `false` | No | Emergency override. If `true`, production can start without secret. Keep `false`. |

| `AIS_UPSTREAM_DRAIN_BATCH` | Railway | `250` (min `1`) | No | Max messages drained per cycle. |
| `AIS_UPSTREAM_DRAIN_BUDGET_MS` | Railway | `20` (min `2`) | No | Max CPU time budget per drain cycle. |

## Platform-Managed Variables (Do Not Manually Set)

These are used only for production detection and are usually injected by platform/runtime.

| Variable | Who sets it | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV` | Runtime/platform | Used to detect production mode. |
| `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` | Railway | Used to detect production relay environment. |
| `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID` | Railway | Used to detect production relay environment. |
| `RAILWAY_STATIC_URL` | Railway | Used to detect production relay environment. |

## 3) Recommended Starting Values (High Traffic Baseline)

These are safe starting points for a busy relay:

```bash
# Auth + routing
RELAY_SHARED_SECRET=<strong-random-secret>
RELAY_AUTH_HEADER=x-relay-key
WS_RELAY_URL=https://<your-railway-relay>.up.railway.app
ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_RELAY=false

# OpenSky cache/cardinality
OPENSKY_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES=256
OPENSKY_NEGATIVE_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES=512
OPENSKY_BBOX_QUANT_STEP=0.01

# AIS pipeline
AIS_SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL_MS=3000
AIS_UPSTREAM_QUEUE_HIGH_WATER=5000
AIS_UPSTREAM_QUEUE_LOW_WATER=1500
AIS_UPSTREAM_QUEUE_HARD_CAP=10000
AIS_UPSTREAM_DRAIN_BATCH=300
AIS_UPSTREAM_DRAIN_BUDGET_MS=20

# Rate limits + metrics
RELAY_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000
RELAY_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=1200
RELAY_OPENSKY_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=600
RELAY_RSS_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=300
RELAY_LOG_THROTTLE_MS=10000
RELAY_METRICS_WINDOW_SECONDS=60
```

## 4) How to Verify Configuration

Health:

```bash
curl -sS https://<relay>/health
```

Metrics (requires relay auth):

```bash
curl -sS https://<relay>/metrics \
  -H "x-relay-key: $RELAY_SHARED_SECRET"
```

or:

```bash
curl -sS https://<relay>/metrics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAY_SHARED_SECRET"
```

Expected checks:

- `auth.sharedSecretEnabled` is `true` in `/health`.
- `/metrics.opensky.hitRatio` is stable and high under load.
- `/metrics.ais.dropsPerSec` stays at `0` in normal operation.
- `/metrics.ais.queueMax` is comfortably below `AIS_UPSTREAM_QUEUE_HARD_CAP`.
